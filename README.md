# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [video-chat-app](https://github.com/aakshita01/video-chat-app.git).
It basically starts with a login page, where we are supposed to login using email-id. Then we go to video calling application where users can call other user using an ID, and will also have the capabiltiy to mute their mic and audio.
